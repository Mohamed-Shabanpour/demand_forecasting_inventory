### **Figure 1: Total Cost Sensitivity Heatmaps by Forecast Model**

**File:** `figures/heatmap_total_cost_<ModelName>.png`  

**Description:**  
These heatmaps show how total inventory costs vary under different combinations of safety stock factor (`z`) and shortage cost (`p`) for each forecasting model (Naive, Moving Average, ETS, ARIMA).  

**Key Insights:**  
- Higher safety stock (`z`) generally increases inventory holding costs.  
- Higher shortage costs (`p`) increase the total cost impact of understocking.  
- ETS and ARIMA models consistently result in **lower total costs** across scenarios, demonstrating the operational value of more accurate forecasts.

### **Figure 2: Inventory Levels Over Time by Forecast Model**

**File:** `figures/inventory_levels.png`  

**Description:**  
This line plot compares inventory levels across periods for all four forecasting models.  

**Key Insights:**  
- Naive and Moving Average forecasts show more **fluctuations in inventory**, leading to occasional shortages.  
- ETS and ARIMA forecasts maintain **smoother inventory trajectories**, better aligning stock with demand.  
- Demonstrates how forecast accuracy directly affects inventory stability and operational performance.

### **Figure 3: Orders Placed Over Time by Forecast Model**

**File:** `figures/orders_placed.png`  

**Description:**  
This plot illustrates the order quantities placed each period under each forecasting model.  

**Key Insights:**  
- Naive forecasts result in **reactive, irregular ordering patterns**.  
- ETS and ARIMA produce **more consistent ordering behavior**, reducing both overstocking and shortages.  
- Highlights the link between forecast method and replenishment strategy efficiency.

### **Figure 4: Average Inventory and Average Shortage by Forecast Model**

**File:** `figures/avg_inventory_shortage.png`  

**Description:**  
This bar chart summarizes the average inventory held and average shortage experienced for each forecasting model.  

**Key Insights:**  
- ETS and ARIMA models achieve **lower average shortages** while maintaining **moderate inventory**, indicating better service-level performance.  
- Naive and Moving Average models either maintain excess inventory or experience frequent shortages.  
- Reinforces the importance of forecast selection for operational decision-making.
