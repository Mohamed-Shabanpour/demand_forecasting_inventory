# Executive Summary

## Purpose
This project investigates how demand forecasting accuracy influences inventory decisions and operational performance under uncertainty.

## Methodology
Classical time-series forecasting models are combined with a base-stock inventory control policy. Forecast errors are explicitly incorporated into safety stock calculations, enabling a structured analysis of uncertainty propagation from forecasting to operational decisions.

## Key Findings
- Improved forecast accuracy reduces total inventory cost and service-level volatility.
- Forecast improvements exhibit diminishing marginal operational value.
- Safety stock decisions are highly sensitive to forecast error estimation.
- Forecast model selection significantly affects downstream inventory performance.

## Research Contribution
This project demonstrates a clear link between forecasting accuracy and operational optimisation, providing a methodological foundation for forecast-informed robust decision-making frameworks in supply chain management.
